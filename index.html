        Dr. Marco Vietor and Paul Crusius have been creating successful
        businesses since college. Now they lead hear.com, the fastest growing
        hearing aid company in the world. This is their story.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s be honest, very few people want to wear hearing aids. Although
        there have been huge improvements in technology, most people don’t use
        them simply because they are still big and ugly. However, Dr. Marco
        Vietor and Paul Crusius wanted to change this perception with a
        revolutionary device developed by the top hearing aid engineers from
        Signia.
      </p>
      <p>
        After many years of research and development, Signia’s (formerly
        Siemens) team of engineers came up with a game-changing hearing aid.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The result:</strong> A hearing device that packs the latest
        German technology in a design so small, it disappears completely inside
        the ear. It’s called the Silk Px by Signia.
      </p>

        <h2>The High-Tech Hearing Aids of the Future:</h2>
        <p>
          This Silk Px comes with smartphone connectivity, allowing you to
          control the device with your iPhone or Android.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, with this device you will notice remarkable improvements
          in your ability to clearly understand speech, even in noisy
          environments like a busy restaurant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Vietor expressed his satisfaction with the Signia engineers’ work:
          <q>
            We can now offer amazing speech clarity and smartphone connectivity
            in a virtually invisible design – and all that for a reasonable
            price!
